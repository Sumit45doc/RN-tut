 - Image is the compnent of react native
 - import {image} from "react-native"
 - Image props:-
   - source (similiar to url in reactjs)
     - If to load local image we need to use require method
     - Ex: source={require('./assets/icon.png')} . <br/> require method return number refering to image.
     - For outside image inside to pass url in object of source as value of uri key.
     - Ex: source={{uri: "https://picsum.photos/200/300?grayscale", width: 200, height: 300}}
     - Note width and height is compulsory filled for outside image because react native cann't access dimension of the image.
